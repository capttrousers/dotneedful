# dotneedful

## TODO:
- this repo needs to be updated to support zsh shells
  - alias file can be symlinked into $ZSH_CUSTOM
  - profile (PATH and open util function) is currently copied into $ZSH_CUSTOM manually, but should automate
  - theres also an arg to be made about combining the dotneedful setup with the apps install and os upgrade utils
  - the aliases vs profile (path and other utils) installs should be separated, so that things are modular and can be cloned but called individually


to house dot files for decent linux setup
will also come with setup script, that will download and install everything
also with powerline install instructions (will not auto install)
and tmux usage readme
